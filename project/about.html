        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="/images/porch.jpg" alt="porch" class="story-image">
        <p>
            Water Gardening began as a small hobby in the backyard of our founder, Ryan Earwood. What started as a single pond with a few fish and plants quickly grew into a passion for all things water gardening. John spent countless hours researching, experimenting, and creating unique water garden designs, each one more beautiful and intricate than the last.
        
            In 2010, Ryan decided to share his passion with the world and started Water Gardening. Our mission is to help others discover the joy and beauty of water gardening. We believe that water gardens can transform any outdoor space into a peaceful and tranquil oasis, and we are committed to helping our customers create the perfect water garden for their needs.
            
            Over the years, we have grown from a small operation in John's backyard to a full-fledged business. We now offer a wide range of water garden plants, fish, and supplies, and we have helped thousands of customers create their own water gardens.
            
            Despite our growth, our passion for water gardening remains the same. We are constantly learning, experimenting, and innovating to bring you the best in water gardening. Whether you're a seasoned water gardener or just starting out, we're here to help you every step of the way.
            
            Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. We can't wait to help you create your own water garden oasis.
